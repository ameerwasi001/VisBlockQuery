# VisBlockQuery
VisBlockQuery is a visual, and block-based programming language that can be used to create queries for NetwordkiteJS. Most queries have a block that can be used in its place so it can be just as powerful as the regular textual query language. This however cannot utilize normal and mutable JavaScript variables, it can however rely on lambda functions.

# Basic Usage
All you have to do is connect self-explanatory(especially if you're familiar with the core query APIs) blocks and the queries are automatically generated on th right side of the screen. It is all very simple and almost trivial to use, the only thing one must do is import appropriately for the generated code.
